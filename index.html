  This is a python helper package for Telebirr H5 Web payment integration
  helper. The use case for this interface is payment via web. Third party system
  will invoke the interface upon payment issue by the customer and a redirect
  page will be return to the third party system from telebirr platform. ##
  Logical specification ![alt text](img/logical design.png "Logical
  spacification") ## Platform Authentication Rule 1. Telebirr platform allocate
  appId and appKey to the corresponding third party client. Each third party
  will have a unique appId and appKey. 2. Third party source IP addresses should
  be added on the trust list. Those IP addresses of clients that are not in the
  trust list will not access telebirr system. 3. The time of the timestamp is
  consistent with that of the server (within one minute). If they are
  inconsistent, the access is considered illegal. 4. Check whether the signature
  entered by the client is consistent with the signature generated by the
  system. If they are inconsistent, the access is considered illegal.
